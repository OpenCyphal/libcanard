        Set to 'n' to disable libcanard assertions.

config CANARD_CRC_TABLE
    bool "Enable libcanard CRC table"
    default y
    help
        Set to 'n' to use slow but ROM-efficient transfer-CRC computation algorithm.
        Doing so is expected to save ca. 500 bytes of ROM and
        increase the cost of RX/TX transfer processing by ~half.
