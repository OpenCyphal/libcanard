/// Libcanard is a compact implementation of the UAVCAN/CAN protocol for high-integrity real-time embedded systems.
/// It is designed for use in robust deterministic embedded systems equipped with at least 32K ROM and 4..8K RAM.
/// The codebase follows the MISRA C rules, has 100% test coverage, and is validated by at least two static analyzers.
/// The library is designed to be compatible with any target platform and instruction set architecture, from 8 to 64
/// bit, little- and big-endian, RTOS-based or baremetal, etc., as long as there is a standards-compliant compiler.
///
///          INTEGRATION
///
/// The library is intended to be integrated into the end application by simply copying the file canard.c into the
/// source tree of the project; it does not require any special compilation options and should work out of the box.
/// There are optional build configuration macros defined near the top of canard.c; they may be used to fine-tune
/// the library for the target platform (but it is not necessary). This header file should be located in the same
/// directory with canard.c, or its location should be in the include look-up paths of the compiler.
///
/// As explained in this documentation, the library requires a deterministic constant-time bounded-fragmentation dynamic
/// memory allocator. If your target platform does not provide a deterministic memory manager (most platforms don't),
/// it is recommended to use O1Heap (MIT licensed): https://github.com/pavel-kirienko/o1heap.
///
/// There is an optional two-file extension library canard_dsdl.c + canard_dsdl.h which can be used alongside
/// this core library to simplify DSDL object serialization and deserialization. It is intended to be integrated in
/// the same manner. Please read its usage manual for further information.
///
/// There are no specific requirements to the underlying I/O layer. Some low-level drivers maintained by the
/// UAVCAN Development Team may be found at https://github.com/UAVCAN/platform_specific_components.
///
/// If your application requires a MISRA C compliance report, please get in touch with the maintainers via the forum
/// at https://forum.uavcan.org.
///
///          ARCHITECTURE
///
/// UAVCAN, as a protocol stack, is composed of two layers: TRANSPORT and PRESENTATION. The transport layer is portable
/// across different transport protocols, one of which is CAN (FD), formally referred to as UAVCAN/CAN. This library
/// is focused on UAVCAN/CAN only and it will not support other transports. The presentation layer is implemented
/// through the DSDL language and the associated data type regulation policies. Much like the UAVCAN stack itself,
/// this library consists of two major components:
///
///      1. TRANSPORT -- the UAVCAN/CAN transport layer implementation. This is implemented in canard.c/.h,
///         the documentation for which you are currently reading. This is the core component of the library.
///
///      2. PRESENTATION -- the optional DSDL support extension library. This is implemented in canard_dsdl.c/.h,
///         an optional component which may be used by some applications where automatic DSDL code generation is
///         not used. Normally, applications may prefer to rely on auto-generated code using DSDL-to-C translators
///         such as Nunavut (https://github.com/UAVCAN/nunavut).
///
/// The DSDL extension is trivial and there is not much to document -- please refer to its header file for details.
///
/// This transport layer implementation consists of two components: the transmission (TX) pipeline and the
/// reception (RX) pipeline.
///
/// The TX and RX pipelines are completely independent from each other except that they both rely on the same
/// dynamic memory manager. The TX pipeline uses the dynamic memory to store outgoing CAN frames in the prioritized
/// transmission queue. The RX pipeline uses the dynamic memory to store contiguous payload buffers for received
/// transfers and for keeping the transfer reassembly state machine data. The exact memory consumption model is defined
/// for both pipelines, so it is possible to statically determine the minimum size of the dynamic memory pool required
/// to guarantee that a given application will never encounter an out-of-memory error at runtime.
///
/// Much like with dynamic memory, the time complexity of every API function is well-characterized, allowing the
/// application to guarantee predictable real-time performance.
///
/// The TX pipeline is managed with the help of three API functions. When the application needs to emit a transfer,
/// it invokes canardTxPush(). The function splits the transfer into CAN frames and stores them into the prioritized
/// transmission queue. The application then picks the CAN frames from the queue one-by-one by calling canardTxPeek()
/// followed by canardTxPop() -- the former allows the application to look at the frame and the latter tells the library
/// that the frame shall be removed from the queue. The returned frames need to be deallocated by the application.
///
/// The RX pipeline is managed with the help of three API functions. The main function canardRxAccept() takes a
/// received CAN frame and updates the appropriate transfer reassembly state machine. The functions canardRxSubscribe()
/// and its counterpart canardRxUnsubscribe() instruct the library which transfers should be received (by default, all
/// transfers are ignored); also the subscription function specifies vital transfer reassembly parameters such as the
/// maximum payload size (i.e., the maximum size of a serialized representation of a DSDL object) and the transfer-ID
/// timeout. Transfers that carry more payload than the configured maximum per subscription are truncated following the
/// Implicit Truncation Rule (ITR) defined by the UAVCAN Specification -- the rule is implemented to facilitate
/// backward-compatible DSDL data type extensibility.
///
/// The library supports a practically unlimited number of redundant transports.
///
/// The library is not thread-safe: if used in a concurrent environment, it is the responsibility of the application
/// to provide adequate synchronization.
///
/// The library is purely reactive: it does not perform any background processing and does not require periodic
/// servicing. Its internal state is only updated as a response to well-specified explicit API calls.

/// The function invokes the dynamic memory manager in the following cases only:
///
///     1. New memory for a session state object is allocated when a new session is initiated.
///        This event occurs when a transport frame that matches a known subscription is received from a node that
///        did not emit matching frames since the subscription was created.
///        Once a new session is created, it is not destroyed until the subscription is terminated by invoking
///        canardRxUnsubscribe(). The number of sessions is bounded and the bound is low (at most the number of nodes
///        in the network minus one), also the size of a session instance is very small, so the removal is unnecessary.
///        Real-time networks typically do not change their configuration at runtime, so it is possible to reduce
///        the time complexity by never deallocating sessions.
///        The size of a session instance is at most 48 bytes on any conventional platform (typically much smaller).
///
///     2. New memory for the transfer payload buffer is allocated when a new transfer is initiated, unless the buffer
///        was already allocated at the time.
///        This event occurs when a transport frame that matches a known subscription is received and it begins a
///        new transfer (that is, the start-of-frame flag is set and it is not a duplicate).
///        The amount of the allocated memory equals the extent as configured via canardRxSubscribe(); please read
///        its documentation for further information about the extent and related edge cases.
///        The worst case occurs when every node on the bus initiates a multi-frame transfer for which there is a
///        matching subscription: in this case, the library will allocate number_of_nodes allocations, where each
///        allocation is the same size as the configured extent.
///
///     3. Memory allocated for the transfer payload buffer may be deallocated at the discretion of the library.
///        This operation does not increase the worst case execution time and does not improve the worst case memory
///        consumption, so a deterministic application need not consider this behavior in the resource analysis.
///        This behavior is implemented for the benefit of applications where rigorous characterization is unnecessary.
///
/// The worst case dynamic memory consumption per subscription is:
///
///     (sizeof(session instance) + extent) * number_of_nodes
///
/// Where sizeof(session instance) and extent are defined above, and number_of_nodes is the number of remote
/// nodes emitting transfers that match the subscription (which cannot exceed (CANARD_NODE_ID_MAX-1) by design).
/// If the dynamic memory pool is sized correctly, the application is guaranteed to never encounter an
/// out-of-memory (OOM) error at runtime. The actual size of the dynamic memory pool is typically larger;
/// for a detailed treatment of the problem and the related theory please refer to the documentation of O1Heap --
/// a deterministic memory allocator for hard real-time embedded systems.
///
/// The time complexity is O(n+p) where n is the number of subject-IDs or service-IDs subscribed to by the application,
/// depending on the transfer kind of the supplied frame, and p is the amount of payload in the received frame
/// (because it will be copied into an internal contiguous buffer). Observe that the time complexity is invariant to
/// the network configuration (such as the number of online nodes) -- this is a very important design guarantee for
/// real-time applications because the execution time is dependent only on the number of active subscriptions for
/// a given transfer kind, and the MTU, both of which are easy to predict and account for. Excepting the
/// subscription search and the payload data copying, the entire RX pipeline contains neither loops nor recursion.
/// Misaddressed and malformed frames are discarded in constant time.
///
/// The function returns 1 (one) if the new frame completed a transfer. In this case, the details of the transfer
/// are stored into out_transfer, and the transfer payload buffer ownership is passed to that object. The lifetime
/// of the resulting transfer object is not related to the lifetime of the input transport frame (that is, even if
/// it is a single-frame transfer, its payload is copied out into a new dynamically allocated buffer storage).
/// If the extent is zero, the payload pointer may be NULL, since there is no data to store and so a
/// buffer is not needed. The application is responsible for deallocating the payload buffer when the processing
/// is done by invoking memory_free on the transfer payload pointer.
///
/// The function returns a negated out-of-memory error if it was unable to allocate dynamic memory.
///
/// The function does nothing and returns a negated invalid argument error immediately if any condition is true:
///     - Any of the input arguments that are pointers are NULL.
///     - The payload pointer of the input frame is NULL while its size is non-zero.
///     - The CAN ID of the input frame is not less than 2**29=0x20000000.
///
/// The function returns zero if any of the following conditions are true (the general policy is that protocol
/// errors are not escalated because they do not construe a node-local error):
///     - The received frame is not a valid UAVCAN/CAN transport frame.
///     - The received frame is a valid UAVCAN/CAN transport frame, but there is no matching subscription,
///       the frame did not complete a transfer, the frame forms an invalid frame sequence, the frame is a duplicate,
///       the frame is unicast to a different node (address mismatch).
///
/// The function is designed to facilitate almost zero-copy data exchange across the protocol stack: once a buffer is
/// allocated, its data is never copied around but only passed by reference. This design allows us to reduce the
/// worst-case execution time and reduce the jitter caused by the linear time complexity of memcpy().
/// One data copy still has to take place, though: from the frame payload into the contiguous transfer payload buffer.
/// In CAN, the MTU is small (at most 64 bytes for CAN FD), so the extra copy does not cost us much here,
/// but it allows us to completely decouple the lifetime of the input frame buffer from the lifetime of the final
/// transfer object, regardless of whether it's a single-frame or a multi-frame transfer.
/// If we were building, say, an UAVCAN/UDP library, then we would likely resort to a different design, where the
/// frame buffer is allocated once from the heap (which may be done from the interrupt handler if the heap is
/// sufficiently deterministic), and in the case of single-frame transfer it is then carried over to the application
/// without copying. This design somewhat complicates the media layer though.
