/**
 * This function can be used to encode values for later transmission in a UAVCAN transfer. It encodes a scalar value -
 * boolean, integer, character, or floating point - and puts it to the specified bit position in the specified
 * contiguous buffer.
 * Simple single-frame transfers can also be encoded manually.
 *
 * Caveat:  This function works correctly only on platforms that use two's complement signed integer representation.
 *          I am not aware of any modern microarchitecture that uses anything else than two's complement, so it should
 *          not affect portability in any way.
 *
 * The type of value pointed to by 'value' is defined as follows:
 *
 *  | bit_length | value points to                          |
 *  |------------|------------------------------------------|
